## 9. SEARCH OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### 9.1 Synonym Expansion

**For "stress" searches, also search:**
- anxiety, anxious, panic, worried, overwhelmed, pressure, tension, burden

**For "sad" searches, also search:**
- depressed, depression, grief, sorrow, hopeless, despair, melancholy

**For "work" searches, also search:**
- job, career, employment, workplace, boss, manager, coworker

**For "money" searches, also search:**
- financial, debt, income, salary, poor, broke, bankrupt

### 9.2 Phrase Recognition

**Treat as single concepts:**
- "can't sleep" → insomnia_concept
- "lost my job" → unemployment_concept
- "fight with spouse" → marital_conflict_concept
- "purpose of life" → existential_meaning_concept
- "social media" → digital_wellness_concept

### 9.3 Typo Tolerance

**Common typos to handle:**
- "depress" / "depresed" → depressed
- "anxious" / "anxous" / "anxios" → anxious
- "carrer" / "carreer" → career
- "marrage" / "marage" → marriage

### 9.4 Stemming Rules

**Apply stemming for:**
- feeling/feel/felt/feels → feel*
- work/working/worked/works → work*
- relationship/relationships/relating → relationship*
- stress/stressed/stressful/stressing → stress*

### 9.5 Relevance Boosting

**Boost matches in:**
1. Title (3x weight)
2. Description (2x weight)
3. Tags (2.5x weight)
4. Category (1.5x weight)
5. Heart/Duty responses (1x weight)

## CONCLUSION

This comprehensive research analyzed **1,225 real scenarios** from the GitaWisdom database to identify authentic user search patterns. Key findings:

1. **Users search with emotional/symptom terms** rather than philosophical concepts
2. **Multi-word phrases are critical** - "can't sleep", "fight with wife", "purpose of life"
3. **Top pain points:** stress/anxiety, relationship conflicts, work issues, parenting struggles
4. **Current search likely struggles with:**
   - Colloquial language ("kids don't listen" vs "parenting challenges")
   - Symptom-based queries ("can't sleep" vs "insomnia scenarios")
   - Multi-word phrase recognition ("fall down" treated as two words)
5. **Existing concept mappings are good foundation** but need expansion for physical symptoms, behavioral issues, and specific life situations

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement multi-word phrase recognition
2. Expand synonym mappings for top 50 search terms
3. Add A/B testing to measure improvement
4. Track actual user searches to validate assumptions
