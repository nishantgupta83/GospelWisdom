## 7. Methodology Notes

**Data Source:** Supabase production database
**Analysis Tool:** `comprehensive_database_analyzer.py`
**Search Method:** Case-insensitive text search across title, description, tags
**Priority Classification:**
- **HIGH Priority:** 0-2 matching scenarios (severe gap)
- **MEDIUM Priority:** 3-5 matching scenarios (moderate gap)
- **LOW Priority:** 6+ matching scenarios (adequate coverage)

**Limitations:**
- Search term matching may miss semantically similar scenarios
- Some life situations may be covered under different terminology
- Tag analysis limited to existing tagging patterns (no semantic clustering)

---

## 8. Conclusion

The GitaWisdom scenario database demonstrates **strong foundational coverage** in Personal Growth, Health & Wellness, and Parenting & Family. However, **critical gaps exist** in crisis situations, mental health emergencies, financial hardship, and marginalized experiences.

**Most Urgent Gaps:**
1. Mental Health Crisis (suicidal thoughts, PTSD, panic attacks)
2. Financial Distress (only 1.2% of database)
3. Life-Altering Trauma (child death, terminal illness, assault)
4. Workplace Hardship (harassment, discrimination, job loss)
5. Chronic Physical Illness (pain, disability, terminal diagnoses)

**Recommended Priority:** Address Tier 1 crisis scenarios immediately (5 scenarios), then systematically expand Financial and Life Events categories (50 scenarios in Phase 1).

With thoughtful content expansion guided by this analysis, GitaWisdom can evolve from a strong personal growth resource into a **comprehensive life guidance system** that serves users in their darkest moments as well as their everyday challenges.
