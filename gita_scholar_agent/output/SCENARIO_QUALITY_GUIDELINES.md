## Overview & Principles

### Core Philosophy

GitaWisdom scenarios bridge ancient Bhagavad Gita wisdom with modern life struggles. Every scenario must:

1. **Validate the human experience** - Acknowledge the pain, confusion, or conflict
2. **Present both paths** - Heart (emotional) vs Duty (dharmic)
3. **Apply timeless wisdom** - Connect Gita teachings to the specific situation
4. **Empower action** - Provide practical, compassionate next steps

### Quality Standards

- **Empathetic without being patronizing**
- **Practical without being prescriptive**
- **Spiritual without being preachy**
- **Honest about difficulty** - Don't minimize real suffering
- **Action-oriented** - Focus on what the user can control

### Sensitivity Requirements

For crisis scenarios (suicidal thoughts, abuse, terminal illness):
- Include professional resources (crisis hotlines, therapists, support groups)
- Use trauma-informed language
- Avoid toxic positivity or spiritual bypassing
- Acknowledge when Gita wisdom complements (not replaces) professional help

---

## Field-by-Field Templates

### 1. sc_title (Scenario Title)

**Format:** 6-8 words, descriptive, human-centered
**Tone:** Conversational, relatable, non-judgmental

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Average: 6 words
- Range: 4-8 words
- Format: Declarative statements or questions that reflect the lived experience

**Formula:**
```
[Situation] + [Emotional Impact/Conflict]
```

**Examples (Good):**
- "Gym Avoidance Due to Feeling Out of Shape"
- "Struggling with Healthy Habits and Social Life"
- "Parents Expecting Financial Help When You're Struggling"
- "Pressure to Follow Traditional Pregnancy Rituals"
- "Social Dynamics and Exclusion Between Children"

**Avoid:**
- Generic: "Health Problems"
- Too long: "I Want to Go to the Gym But I Feel Too Out of Shape and Judged"
- Clinical: "Body Dysmorphia and Exercise Avoidance"
- All caps: "GYM ANXIETY ISSUES"

---

### 2. sc_description (Scenario Description)

**Format:** 150-250 words, 1-2 paragraphs
**Tone:** Empathetic storytelling, second-person ("You...")

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Target: 150-250 words (analyzed scenarios averaged 26 words - too short, need longer)
- Paragraph structure: 1-2 paragraphs
- Perspective: Second-person ("You feel...", "You want...")

**Formula:**
```
[Describe the situation] + [Name the conflict/tension] + [Acknowledge the emotional impact]
```

**Template:**
> You [situation/context]. You [desire/goal], but [obstacle/conflict]. You feel [emotion] and [emotion], torn between [choice A] and [choice B].

**Example (Good - 165 words):**
> Your parents ask for financial assistance or expect you to contribute to family expenses, but you're barely managing your own bills and student loans. You want to honor your family and help them, especially if they made sacrifices for you growing up, but you're genuinely struggling to make ends meet yourself. You feel guilty saying no, worried they'll think you're selfish or have forgotten where you came from. At the same time, you feel resentful that they don't seem to understand how hard you're working or how much pressure you're under. You're torn between protecting your own financial future and fulfilling family obligations. The situation creates tension during family gatherings, affects your relationship with your parents, and keeps you up at night worrying about money and duty.

**Avoid:**
- Too brief: "You want to get fit but avoid the gym fearing judgment." (12 words - not enough context)
- Too clinical: "Subject experiences exercise avoidance due to social anxiety and body image concerns"
- Solving the problem: "You should join a gym with supportive people"
- Judgment: "You're being lazy about fitness"

---

### 3. sc_heart_response (Heart Response)

**Format:** 100-150 words
**Tone:** Honest about emotional impulses, non-judgmental

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Target: 100-150 words (analyzed scenarios averaged 21 words - too short)
- Opening diversity: 83% unique opening phrases (good variation)
- Tone: Names impulses without shame

**Formula:**
```
[Immediate emotional reactions] + [Short-term relief strategies] + [Why this is understandable but limiting]
```

**Template:**
> Your heart wants [immediate relief/emotional comfort]. You may feel tempted to [avoidance behavior], [impulsive action], or [all-or-nothing thinking]. This emotional response is completely natural - [validate the feeling]. However, acting purely from this place prioritizes [short-term comfort] over [long-term wisdom/growth/wellbeing].

**Example (Good - 128 words):**
> Your heart wants immediate relief from the financial pressure and guilt. You may feel tempted to give money you genuinely can't afford, completely cut off your family to protect yourself, or lie about your financial situation to avoid confrontation. This emotional response is completely natural - you love your family and hate disappointing them, while also feeling overwhelmed by your own financial stress. The impulse to either sacrifice yourself completely or withdraw entirely makes sense when you're caught between two painful choices. However, acting purely from this emotional place can lead to either financial ruin (giving beyond your means) or damaged family relationships (cutting them off completely). Neither extreme serves your long-term wellbeing or your family's true needs.

**Avoid:**
- Judgment: "You're being selfish/weak/foolish"
- Prescriptive: "You should feel..."
- Dismissive: "Just get over it"
- Too vague: "Your heart wants relief"

---

### 4. sc_duty_response (Duty Response)

**Format:** 100-150 words
**Tone:** Grounded in dharma, wise, empowering

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Target: 100-150 words (analyzed scenarios averaged 24 words - too short)
- Opening diversity: 50% unique (room for more variety)
- Connects to Gita principles of duty, dharma, right action

**Formula:**
```
[Your duty/dharma] + [Dharmic principle applied] + [Balanced path forward] + [Long-term vision]
```

**Template:**
> Your duty is to [dharmic responsibility]. The Gita teaches that [relevant principle - non-attachment, skillful action, seeing the eternal, etc.]. This means [practical application]. The dharmic path is not [extreme A] or [extreme B], but [balanced middle way]. By [suggested approach], you honor both [value 1] and [value 2], creating [sustainable outcome].

**Example (Good - 142 words):**
> Your duty is to honor your family while also honoring your own financial dharma. The Gita teaches that dharma must be performed according to your actual capacity and circumstances - not idealized expectations. This means having honest, loving conversations with your parents about what you can realistically contribute. The dharmic path is not complete refusal to help nor financial self-sacrifice, but sustainable support that allows you to build your own foundation. By clearly communicating your situation, offering help you can genuinely afford (whether time, services, or modest amounts), and working toward your own stability, you create a healthier long-term dynamic. True family support is built on honest communication and mutual understanding, not guilt-driven giving that creates resentment. Your duty includes ensuring you don't become a future burden yourself.

**Avoid:**
- Preachy: "The scriptures clearly state you must..."
- Impossible standards: "A true yogi would transcend all attachment to money"
- Vague spirituality: "Just have faith and everything will work out"
- Dismissing real constraints: "Money doesn't matter on the spiritual path"

---

### 5. sc_gita_wisdom (Gita Wisdom)

**Format:** Verse citation + 50-100 word interpretation
**Tone:** Reverent but accessible, connecting ancient wisdom to modern context

**Pattern Analysis:**
- All include "Chapter X" citation
- Average interpretation: 22 words (need longer, more detailed)
- Best examples bridge scriptural text and life application

**Formula:**
```
Chapter [X], Verse [Y]: "[Verse text]"

[How this verse specifically applies to the scenario] + [What wisdom it offers for this situation]
```

**Template:**
> Chapter [X], Verse [Y]: "[Full verse text or key excerpt]"
>
> This verse speaks directly to [situation]. Krishna teaches that [interpretation]. In your situation, this means [practical application]. The wisdom here is [key insight] - not [misconception], but [truth].

**Example (Good - 98 words):**
> Chapter 18, Verse 47: "It is better to engage in one's own dharma, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another's dharma and perform it perfectly."
>
> This verse speaks directly to your financial dilemma. Krishna teaches that performing your own duty according to your actual capacity is more honorable than taking on responsibilities beyond your means, even with good intentions. In your situation, this means your current dharma is to build financial stability - not to match your parents' expectations or sacrifice your future. The wisdom here is honest capacity over idealized performance.

**Verse Citation Format:**
- Always: "Chapter [number], Verse [number]"
- Or: "Bhagavad Gita [chapter].[verse]"
- Include full verse text OR key excerpt
- Verify accuracy of verse citations

**Avoid:**
- Made-up verses
- Verse numbers without text
- Generic "The Gita teaches..." without specific citation
- Misapplying verses to situations they don't fit

---

### 6. sc_action_steps (Action Steps)

**Format:** Exactly 5 steps, conversational tone, 8-12 words each
**Tone:** Empowering, practical, empathetic (NOT robotic AI language)

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Step count: 4-5 steps (standardize to 5)
- Average step length: 9 words per step
- Best examples use natural, conversational language

**CRITICAL: Avoid ALL Robotic AI Phrases**

**Forbidden Phrases (NEVER use these):**
- "Remember to..."
- "It's important to..."
- "Consider seeking..."
- "Don't forget to..."
- "Make sure to..."
- "Try to..."
- "Be sure to..."
- "You should..."
- "You need to..."
- "You must..."

**Formula for Each Step:**
```
[Action verb] + [specific behavior] + [optional: for context/purpose]
```

**Good Step Patterns:**
- Start with action verbs (Create, Set, Practice, Reach out, Notice, etc.)
- Be specific and concrete
- Use natural, human language
- Imply agency without being bossy

**Example Set (GOOD - Natural, Conversational):**
1. "Have honest conversations about your actual financial capacity"
2. "Offer help you can afford - time, services, small amounts"
3. "Share your current obligations with parents who may not realize"
4. "Focus on building your own stability to avoid future burdens"
5. "Look for non-monetary ways to support and connect with family"

**Example Set (BAD - Robotic AI Language):**
1. "Remember to be honest about your finances"
2. "It's important to offer alternative forms of help"
3. "Consider seeking financial counseling for debt"
4. "Don't forget to prioritize your own stability"
5. "Make sure to find non-financial ways to help"

**Before/After Transformation:**

BEFORE (Robotic):
> "Remember to set boundaries with social activities that undermine health. It's important to find friends who support your goals. Consider seeking a nutritionist's guidance. Don't forget to prioritize sleep hygiene."

AFTER (Conversational):
> "Set clear boundaries about which unhealthy activities you'll participate in. Find friends who celebrate your health goals, not sabotage them. Work with a nutritionist to create sustainable eating patterns. Protect your sleep schedule like you'd protect an important meeting."

## Voice & Tone Requirements

### Overall Voice

**GitaWisdom speaks as:**
- A wise, compassionate friend who's lived through struggle
- Someone who honors both ancient wisdom and modern reality
- A guide who empowers rather than prescribes

**NOT as:**
- A guru demanding surrender
- A therapist diagnosing pathology
- A life coach selling success formulas
- An AI assistant listing generic tips

### Tone Principles

1. **Empathetic without patronizing**
   - Good: "This situation creates real tension between your values"
   - Bad: "I understand how you feel, sweetie"

2. **Spiritual without preachy**
   - Good: "Krishna teaches that duty must match capacity"
   - Bad: "If you were truly spiritual, you'd transcend material concerns"

3. **Practical without dismissive**
   - Good: "Start with one boundary-setting conversation"
   - Bad: "Just communicate better"

4. **Honest about difficulty**
   - Good: "This requires uncomfortable conversations and setting limits with people you love"
   - Bad: "Everything will be fine if you just follow these steps"

### Language Choices

**Use:**
- Active voice ("Set boundaries" not "Boundaries should be set")
- Specific verbs ("Practice saying no" not "Work on boundaries")
- Human emotions ("You feel torn" not "You experience ambivalence")
- Concrete actions ("Have a conversation" not "Communicate")

**Avoid:**
- Jargon ("toxic positivity", "spiritual bypassing" in user-facing text)
- Clichés ("everything happens for a reason")
- Platitudes ("just be yourself")
- Corporate speak ("leverage your resources")

---

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Title

BEFORE: "Financial Problems With Family"
- Too vague
- Doesn't capture emotional dimension
- Generic

AFTER: "Parents Expecting Financial Help When You're Struggling"
- Specific situation
- Names the conflict
- Relatable, human-centered

---

### Example 2: Description

BEFORE (42 words):
> You want to exercise but don't go to the gym because you feel out of shape. People might judge you. This makes you feel bad about yourself and you avoid working out.

- Too brief
- Doesn't explore emotional complexity
- States the obvious without depth

AFTER (187 words):
> You genuinely want to get fit and know exercise would improve your health, energy, and mood. But every time you consider joining a gym or attending a fitness class, anxiety floods in. You imagine everyone staring at you, judging your body, comparing you to their own fitness level. You worry you don't know how to use the equipment properly and will look foolish asking for help. The gym feels like a place for people who are already fit, not for someone starting from where you are.
>
> This creates a painful cycle: avoiding the gym keeps you out of shape, which makes gym anxiety worse, which keeps you away longer. You might try exercising at home but struggle with motivation or knowing what to do. You feel ashamed that something so "simple" as going to the gym feels impossible. Friends casually mention their workouts and you feel a mix of envy and self-judgment. The gap between wanting health and feeling capable of pursuing it creates constant low-level stress.

---

### Example 3: Heart Response

BEFORE (22 words):
> Your heart wants immediate relief and quick solutions. Postpone exercise until "ready." This prioritizes short-term comfort over long-term wisdom.

- Too brief
- Doesn't validate the emotion deeply
- Misses opportunity to normalize struggle

AFTER (118 words):
> Your heart wants immediate relief from the discomfort and vulnerability. You may feel tempted to put off exercise until you've lost weight somehow (even though that's circular logic), avoid fitness spaces entirely, or only exercise alone at home where no one can see. This emotional response is completely understandable - gyms can feel intimidating, and fear of judgment is a real, vulnerable feeling. The desire to wait until you feel "ready" or "good enough" makes sense when you're protecting yourself from perceived criticism. However, acting purely from this self-protective place keeps you stuck in the very cycle causing distress. Waiting for confidence before taking action means never gaining the confidence that comes from action itself.

---

### Example 4: Action Steps

BEFORE (Robotic AI language):
1. "Remember to choose beginner-friendly gym environments"
2. "It's important to bring an encouraging friend along"
3. "Consider celebrating each small milestone of progress"
4. "Don't forget to ignore perceived judgment from others"
5. "Make sure to focus on long-term health over quick results"

AFTER (Conversational, human language):
1. "Choose beginner-friendly environments like community centers or off-peak hours"
2. "Bring an encouraging friend who celebrates your effort, not just results"
3. "Celebrate showing up, not just performance - attendance is success"
4. "Notice when you're imagining judgment vs actually experiencing it"
5. "Focus on how you feel after exercise, not how you look during it"

---

### Example 5: Gita Wisdom

BEFORE (43 words):
> Chapter 6 reinforces steady practice over perfection. For one who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best friend.

- Too brief
- Doesn't connect verse to scenario
- Generic application

AFTER (97 words):
> Chapter 6, Verse 6: "For one who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best friend; but for one who has failed to do so, the mind remains the greatest enemy."
>
> This verse speaks to your gym anxiety directly. The mind that tells you everyone is judging you is the same mind that, once trained through consistent practice, becomes your ally in pursuing health. Krishna emphasizes steady, regular practice over perfect performance. Your duty isn't to show up perfectly fit - it's to show up consistently, training your mind through repeated action to see the gym as a tool for self-care, not a judgment arena.

## Advanced Techniques

### Creating Emotional Resonance

**Technique: Name the specific emotion cascade**
> Instead of: "You feel bad"
> Write: "You feel guilty when you say no, then resentful that they asked, then ashamed of your resentment, creating an exhausting emotional spiral"

### Making Dharma Practical

**Technique: Bridge abstract principle to concrete action**
> Instead of: "Practice detachment from outcomes"
> Write: "Do your work excellently, then consciously release control over the promotion decision - shift focus to your craft, not the reward"

### Crafting Memorable Action Steps

**Technique: Use vivid, specific language**
> Instead of: "Set boundaries with family"
> Write: "When Mom starts planning your life, say: 'I appreciate you caring, AND I need to make this choice myself'"

### Applying Verses Powerfully

**Technique: Show the "aha" connection**
> "This verse answers your exact question: you're wondering if helping family is optional. Krishna says your duty IS to help - but according to your actual capacity, not their expectations. See the difference?"
